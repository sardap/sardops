## 3. Key Findings
### What worked
-  

### Issues / Bugs
- [X] After new pet somehow gone out instantly probably not reseting the state but should have validates 
- [X] Babies should poo more (Poop was broken unless coffee was being drunk)
- [X] Need more to do with baby
- [X] Stomach shake needs to be more
- [X] Sick too much
- [X] Evolve is super laggy on pico
- [X] Freezing at end of explore
- [X] Sleeping Z's missing I think after dream?
- [X] Stomach shake isn't clear
- [X] Need more idle before clearing
- [X] Need to rethink books and chapters for activity cooldown can be like an hour without books being impossible to complete I think if books are always broken into like 20 min chunks that would be for the best
- [X] Need some indaction of when sick of food will expire
- [X] Food select movement is strange near the top
- [X] Should stay up on NYE
- [X] Should not be able to start exploring if sick
- [X] healing needs to be cheaper across the board
- [X] sickness should have a chance to just go away
- [X] NYE Fireworks at midnight
- [X] Skipping the explore results screen I think if it poos but that doesn't make sense But only after a long time to make it harder to debug Not related to poop. Might be due if they get nothing? IT'S BECAUSE OF THE INPUT TIMER OMG
- [X] Location should at most have 10 checks that run over the course should add more randomness
- [X] Explore post screen seems to be showing percent gotten not amount gotten 
- [] should not go out if egg will hatch soon
- [] Skull not showing when Sick PICO ONLY CAN"T FIND ON PC
- [] Telescope sky is blank on home PICO ONLY CAN"T FIND ON PC
- [] add 10% cost range add some variation rounded to closest 50 
- [] Beef bowel food that unlocks the beef dimsion
- [] have low chance when they go out to bring back items or money
